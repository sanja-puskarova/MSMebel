<h3>Description</h3>
<hr/>
<p>This aplication is used to display products in a furniture store that is named MSMebel.We see the application from the point of view of an aministrator, since the 
application has no security.If it was a regular customer some activities would be hidden(e.g Add,edit,delete products and decorations).
The user can see all the products,decorations and rooms.Products and decorations can be added, edited,deleted and displayed.If a customer likes some of the products
he can create rooms with the products, which he can purchase in the future.With creating rooms the customer benefits by adding more products to a room.
The products must be added by their correct name.With adding more products he gets more discount that is calculated by our discount formula.Also the customer
can add review for the store and write a comment for their experience.And last but not least the customer can view what we stand for and some statistics of our 
success in the About Us page.</p>

<h4>Back-end</h4>
To connect to the database, you need to create database with:
<br/>
<br/>
<b>name: msmebel,</b><br/>
<b>user: postgres,</b><br/>
<b>password: admin,</b><br/>
<br/>
You need to execute all queries located in <b>msmebel2/SQL</b> to populate the database.
<br/><br/>
For starting the back-end app, you need to build the backend module and run the main class <b>‘com.example.msmebel2.Msmebel2Application’.</b>
